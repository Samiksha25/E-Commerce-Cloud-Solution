## Detailed Database Design Requirements
1. City mart can have many user groups. Each User Group can
be uniquely identified by User Group ID. For each user, we will store the ID of the user which will be unique to each user, first name, middle
name, last name, phone number (one or multiple), date of birth, age (which will be derived from the Date of
birth), gender and email address (there can be multiple email addresses). Each user can either be an Admin or
Customer.
2. Each user would have their own login details which will store the password.
3. The address of each user will be uniquely identified by an ID and would have the name of the building,
street name, city, zip code, state, and type of address like home, office, etc. We will note if the address given by
the user is their primary address. Each user can have multiple addresses associated with their account.
4. Each address can be associated with a country, region, state and the zip-code which will be identified
by their own unique ID. Each state would also have the tax rate.
5. Every customer has the access to create a cart which will have a unique cartID, delivery date, order tax,
cart creation date and the order date. From the given information about the given order, the total cart items,
estimated delivery date as well as the total amount can be derived. As the products will be added to the cart, a
new order line will be created defining the quantity, unit of measure and hence calculating the price.
6. Once the purchase order has been made with a unique ID and the purchase order date, it will contain
purchase order details with the quantity of the products.
7. Each product will have various attributes like product ID, name. manufacturer, brand, sub brand, type,
size, unit size and the price. Each product is associated with an image which has its ID, description, type, name
and a supplier which has its own ID, name and type. Category to which the product belongs is also an
important factor with its unique ID, name and description.
8. There can be many stores that deliver the product as mentioned in the website with the unique
storeID, name, phone, email and the address consisting of store city, state and zip code.
